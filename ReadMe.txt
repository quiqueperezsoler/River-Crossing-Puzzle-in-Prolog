******************* PROBLEM OF THE RIVER CROSSING *******************

* The file contained in the folder is already an executable in the
  SWI-Prolog platform. The steps for running it are:
  
	1. In the upper bar menu: "File->Consult" and select the file 
	   ("TheRiverPuzzle.pl")
	2. Once it has compiled a warning message should appear 
	   (the warning message has nothing to do with the code, i did
	    it because SWI apparently doesn't leave trace of the compiling
		when it finishes)
	3. Last step is execute the program writing: "solution.", after
	   entering the terminal will ask for the initial parameters.
	   
	   
The purpose of this project is to make use of the skills learnt through the lectures
of Logic Programming and to practise the implementation of a program in the
Prolog language. After searching for an interesting topic to address in my project
for this course I was referred to everytime to singular mathematical and logical
problems. Or rather, paradigms of puzzles that play with the concepts of logic
above all. After a deep search I finally settled for the River Crossing puzzle, or the
problem of the Fox, the Goose and the bag of Beans. Iâ€™ve tried to use the knowledge
i have learn during the course and tried to elaborate a complex problem to
showcase the concepts of this subject. To make matters easier i have modified
the problem and used instead Foxes, Sheeps and Beans.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTED IN 2017-2018
