******************* PROBLEM OF THE RIVER CROSSING *******************

* The file contained in the folder is already an executable in the
  SWI-Prolog platform. The steps for running it are:
  
	1. In the upper bar menu: "File->Consult" and select the file 
	   ("TheRiverPuzzle.pl")
	2. Once it has compiled a warning message should appear 
	   (the warning message has nothing to do with the code, i did
	    it because SWI apparently doesn't leave trace of the compiling
		when it finishes)
	3. Last step is execute the program writing: "solution.", after
	   entering the terminal will ask for the initial parameters.
